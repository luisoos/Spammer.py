# Spammer.py

This is spammer.py. You can spam the whole text.txt file with it, in just a few lines of python. 

## Setup
Fill in the text.txt file with the things that you want to spam, set the time between the individual paragraphs by editing the "time.sleep(YOUR_TIME)" element (I have it set to 3 seconds right now). Then press start and quickly head over to the place, you want to spam in.
##### You may use PyCharm!
